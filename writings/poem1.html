“First”<br>
    <br>
    <br>
i'm lying here, lifeless<br>
in the corner of my cell,<br>
rotting in the mess<br>
i've made and known so well.<br>
<br>
0ne time a storm came, one of many,<br>
along with the mind getting bleak and weary.<br>
i witnessed a thunder pierce right through the window -<br>
the wind rushed inside and whispered: "Flee, flee to the meadow!"<br>
<br>
i crawled outside through the broken glass,<br>
in the middle of the field I fell and let the hours pass.<br>
Remains of the transparent wall tore up all the closed cuts,<br>
and through them, the acid rain poured inside, dissolving my guts.<br>
<br>
And i waited for the goddamn Sun,<br>
for it to reveal my overcoming; that i won.<br>
Then i stood up, nearly blind and sore,<br>
only to realise there's no one around, anymore.<br>
<br>
The triumph was never meant to last long;<br>
i got striked by the wind that came back so strong.<br>
Knocked out, something dragged me back to the locked room,<br>
Then woke up to a familiar, filthy odor of doom.<br>
<br>
Now i'm one with the darkness<br>
in the corner of my cell,<br>
intertwined with the mess<br>
i've made and known so well.<br>
